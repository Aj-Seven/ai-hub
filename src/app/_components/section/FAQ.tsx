              AI Hub supports top-tier models from OpenAI, Anthropic (Claude),
              Google Gemini, Cohere, and Ollama for running models locally. You

            <AccordionContent>
              No coding is required. Simply provide your API keys from supported
              providers. If you're using Ollama, you’ll just need to install it
              and ensure it’s running on your local machine.

            <AccordionContent>
              Yes — your API keys are stored only in your browser's local
              storage. They never leave your device or get sent to any external
              server.

              credits.
